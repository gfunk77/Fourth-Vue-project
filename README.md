# Fourth-Vue-project

Adding Dynamic and inline styles with Vue

box1 - uses :style in combination with a ternary statement. If the box is clicked the color will be #fa5246 otherwise it will be blue

box2 - use :class if the box is clicked the color will be #fa5246 otherwise the default style is applied

box3 - :class uses an array to hold the possible style options

box4 - default is added as a permanent class. When box4 is clicked, the active class will toggle on and off.

box5 - use a computed property to check if it is selected. boxClasses returns an array of class options
